def change_xo(x_o):
    '''
    Switch turns. If x just went, switch to o. If o just went, switch 
    back to x. Takes a string char, returns a string char.
    Parameters:
        x_o: The last player to make a move.
    Returns: Updated turn

    '''
    Asks the user which space to occupy with an x or o. Returns an 
    updated tic-tac-toe table.
    Parameters:
        x_o: The player to make the next move.
        tic_tac_toe: The string tic_tac_toe table containing 1-9 and/
            or x's and o's.
        int_list: a list of digits in string format 1-9 representing
            all possible available spaces.
    Returns: An updated tic_tac_toe table as a string.

    If all possible moves have been made and there still is no winner, 
    declare the winner to be a "cats game". This works best if the rest 
    of the program has been run and there is still no winner.
    Parameters:
        short_ttt: A short list representation of the tic_tac_toe board
            with a length of 9, containing string characters 1-9 and/or
            x's and o's.
